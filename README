In the 7.07 Dueling Fates update for Dota 2, a new feature was added:

* Each day 10 heroes are selected automatically as bonus heroes for the day. Bonus heroes provide you with a free mango on selection (cannot be sold).

This command line program outputs the bonus heroes for each day.
(Dota 2 uses its own implementation. I'm not a Valve employee.)

Files:

* bonus.c - source
* bonus.exe - compiled program
* bonus.txt - output of the program
* build.sh - command to build the program
* heroes.h - hero names ordered by hero ID
* README - you're reading it
* vstdlib.dll/tier0.dll - Dota 2 library from game/bin/win64 used for its PRNG

Technical details:

The heroes are generated by taking the current day number (Unix time / 86400) and using it as the seed for a PRNG.
This PRNG is then used to generate numbers between 0 and 114, until 10 different numbers are created.
Each number n selects the hero with the nth hero ID (see game/dota/scripts/npc/npc_heroes.txt).

Until 1 November, due to a bug the selected heroes were cempletely random every game on Valve servers.
Between 6 November and 5 December there was a bug that caused the bonus heroes to not match the list and sometimes generate only 9 heroes.
On 1 March, 7.10 was released:

* Bonus hero count increased from 10 to 12
